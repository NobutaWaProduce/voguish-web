 				 	<p>  Before there was man, before there was a world, there was nothing but darkness and light. In that lived an all powerful omniscient being. He had a journal that created anything he wrote in it. So he created a world, and in that world lived man. Man was at first peaceful, but there is always darkness withing the light. Soon man turned agaisnt one another, destroying their world and causing chaos. So the being then created other worlds, hoping they would do better. He tried to help them, but when he did nothing changed. They stayed violent. So the being gave up on them. He let the different worlds go on, letting them destroy one another.</p>
 					<p>One of the being's creation was the king of time and space. He loved to make bets because he always won. So he decided to make a bet with his creator. He would take three pages from his journal, creating three new journals, and he would give them to the people that lived in the world he had created. If those people created better things then he would have to help his creations that he abondoned. If they did not then the king would give up all of his power. So they made the bet, and the king was not even sure he would win this. He just hoped that he would.</p>

       	  		  <h3>The beginning</h3>

       	  		  <p>In the beginning there were only the K universes, the universes that the keepers live in, K1, K2, and K3. The three universes were very similar. The keepers did not live in eachother's universe, but they do know about one another. The first and the second keeper created many different universes for their creations to live in, while the third allowed his creations to live in his universe, an error he fixed later on. When the keepers learned about one another, so did their creations.</p>

       	  		  <h3>The Middle</h3>

       	  		  <p>The universes that they created for their main creations was univers I, II, and III. Universe I was ruled by the first keeper's creations. It was medieval and magical. It was clear the first keeper cared about hisrtoy. It was peaceful there until his creations took over. They made the people go mad. They divided the people, causing a war in the land. Universe II was a large kingdom that was mixed with science and magic. It was clear the second keeper loved science and magic. When their creations came they took over most of it, dictating everyone, claiming it was the only way to have peace. Universe III was like a fairy tale. It was magical and beautiful. The third keeper loved fairy tales. When their creations joined the universe they twisted their beloved fairytales.</p>

       	  		  <h3>The End</h3>

       	  		  <p>The keepers created more universes as time went on, and only the second keeper's creations knew. The dark ones did not like this so they decided to take over their universe, but they knew they needed help. So they saught the help of the first and the third keeper's darak creations and they gladly helped. They took over many universe, ruling them with and iron fist. The light creations of the keepers knew they had to stop it, so they went to those univserses and fought back. They did what every they could to get rid of the dark, but it's hard to live in the light without darkness.</p>

       	  		<li class="span_2-right">
       	  		  <h3>Now</h3>

       	  		  <p>Almost all universes are in some type of darkness. The war between the light and the dark is one that may never end. The keepers are slowly loosing hope, regreting everything that they have done. The more they give up, the more power their creations gain. The dark creations are full of joy because of this, but the light creations are full of sorrow. They do not wish to see their creators so weak.</p>
