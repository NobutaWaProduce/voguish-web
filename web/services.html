						<p>The Keepers are the people who the king gave the journals too. When he gave them the journals they were all very young, being only the age of five. He felt that children would be more likely to create things of joy, but if they did not, if their life forced them do different things, then maybe the being that created their world would see the errors of his ways. </p>
		                <p>Each of the keeper did not have a kind life though. Each of them were obsessed with something. Insanity. Fear. Death. Those things affected the keepers so much their once pure minds because their greatest enemies. </p>

One of his first creations was Blu, the actual blue monster in the corner. His family though that he was going insane when he cried about seeing the monster.</p>

Things started going down hill. She was scared that her family was fall apart because she always saw everyone in emotional distress. This caused her to create people that could help her hide her emotions, deal with them. She wanted to be strong, she didn't want to be scared. She managed to hided it well for a long time, but when she told her family about the people she saw they were scared for her.</p>

His close friend died and he was scared of death. He didn't like the though of death or how it worked. He went mad when he found out how they died, and soon he wanted to forget everything so he could start a new life.</p>
