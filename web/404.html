						<p>The Diabolik Army was founded by Hiro, X, and Eleven. They created it that way there could be someone to go against F.E.A.R. and give people home. To let them know that F.E.A.R. is not everything in their world. The Diabolik Army at first was only for protecting people. They did not fight F.E.A.R. They simply offered safety for those with pure intentions.</p>
		                <p>The Diabolik Army began to fight back though when Lord Bloodgate, one of the rulers of F.E.A.R. entered their sanctuary. They are F.E.A.R's greatest threat and only offer safety to the kingdoms who are willing to obey theeir rules that way they may all have peace. They do preform some genetic exparaments, but not many because of the price they must pay for it.</p>

He went mad when he found out how they died, and soon he wanted to forget everything so he could start a new life.</p>
